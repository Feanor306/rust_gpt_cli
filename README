[rust_gpt_cli] is a CLI tool that communicates with OpenAI GPT model. It creates a stream for each prompt and streams the response back to the terminal asynchroniously. 

# Set Properties
The program uses the following environment variables.
```bash
# OpenAI API KEY. Mandatory.
OPENAI_API_KEY="key"
# Max number of tokens the model will use. 
# Includes Prompt Length + Response Length
# 1 token is approximately 4 characters or 0.75 words
OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS="200"
```

TODO Features:
1. Process output in queue so we can detect code blocks and change color/style of output
2. Package / crate deployment + description
3. Option to switch model (query endpoint models?)
4. Option to query a different endpoint
